# Course Tasks Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python tasks designed to enhance programming skills through practice. Each task focuses on different aspects of Python, including random number generation, functional programming, and data analysis.

## Python Version

This project requires **Python 3.12.5**. It is recommended to use the latest version of Python 3.x to ensure compatibility with all tasks.

## Task 1: Multiplication Quiz

**Description**:  
A simple multiplication quiz game that generates random multiplication problems for the user to solve. The quiz keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback based on their performance.

**Functionality**:
- Generates a series of random multiplication problems.
- Validates user input to ensure it's a valid integer.
- Tracks and displays the user's score and provides feedback on their performance.

**How to Run**:  
Run the `multiplication_quiz()` function to start the quiz.

## Task 2: Apply Operation to a List

**Description**:  
A function that applies a specified operation to each element of a list of numbers. This task demonstrates the use of lambda functions and list comprehensions.

**Operations**:
- Doubling the numbers.
- Squaring the numbers.
- Filtering out even numbers to leave only odd numbers.

**How to Run**:  
Call the `apply_operation()` function with a list of numbers and a lambda function specifying the desired operation.

## Task 3: Student Grade Analysis

**Description**:  
A script that performs analysis on a list of students and their grades. It extracts unique grades, identifies top performers, and lists students who failed based on their scores.

**Analysis**:
- Extracts and displays unique grades.
- Identifies the top three performers.
- Lists students who scored less than 51, marking them as failed.

**How to Run**:  
Simply run the script to see the results of the grade analysis.

## Task 4: Student Grades Management

**Description**:  
A Python script that uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage student grades. It defines classes for students and classrooms, allowing you to add grades, calculate averages, and determine top-performing and failing students.

**Functionality**:  
- Defines a `Student` class to store a student's name and grades.
- Implements methods to add grades and calculate the average grade.
- Defines a `Classroom` class to manage multiple students.
- Provides methods to identify the top three students and those who failed.

**How to Run**:  
Instantiate the `Student` and `Classroom` classes, add grades to students, and use the provided methods to analyze the classroom's performance.
